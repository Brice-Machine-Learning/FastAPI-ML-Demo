    "When calling the `/predict` endpoint, the request payload looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"features\": [6.0, 25.0, 6.0, 1.0, 900, 3.0, 34.05, -118.25]\n",
    "}\n",
    "The `features` array contains 8 values, each corresponding to a specific feature used by the model. The order of these features is crucial, as the model expects them in a predefined sequence.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The order of features is as follows:\n",
    "1. `MedInc`: Median income in block group *(in tens of thousands of dollars)*\n",
    "2. `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group *(years)*\n",
    "3. `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household\n",
    "4. `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household\n",
    "5. `Population`: Block group population *(census tract: number of people.  Could be within a block group or neighborhood)*\n",
    "6. `AveOccup`: Average number of household members\n",
    "7. `Latitude`: Block group latitude *(degrees)*\n",
    "8. `Longitude`: Block group longitude *(degrees)*\n",
    "Each value in the `features` array corresponds to the respective feature in the order listed above. For example, in the provided payload:\n",
    "- `6.0` corresponds to `MedInc`\n",
    "- `25.0` corresponds to `HouseAge`\n",
    "- `6.0` corresponds to `AveRooms`\n",
    "- `1.0` corresponds to `AveBedrms`\n",
    "- `900` corresponds to `Population`\n",
    "- `3.0` corresponds to `AveOccup`\n",
    "- `34.05` corresponds to `Latitude`\n",
    "- `-118.25` corresponds to `Longitude`\n",
    "When preparing the input for the model, ensure that the features are provided in this exact order to guarantee accurate predictions.\n"
